    This function applies a series of SQL transforms to a data frame. Each transform is
    implemented as a function and is passed in the cleaning_queue list.

    If print_intermediate is set to True, the function will print the data frame after
    each transform. The filter_sql parameter can be used to filter the data frame
    before printing, but it doesn't affect the actual data processing.

    If filter_sql is not provided, the entire data frame will be printed.

    Args:
        df (DuckDBPyRelation): The input data frame to which the SQL transforms are
            applied.
        cleaning_queue (List[Callable]): A list of functions that implement SQL
            transforms.
        print_intermediate (bool, optional): Whether to print the data frame after each
            transform. Defaults to False.
        filter_sql (Optional[str], optional): A SQL condition to filter the data frame
            before printing. Doesn't affect the data processing. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        DuckDBPyRelation: The data frame after all transforms have been applied.
